/*
STL :- An STL is a library of generic functions and classes which saves you time and energy which you would have spent constructing for your use. This helps you reuse these well tested classes and functions umpteenth number of times according to your own convenience.

Containers :- Container is an object which stores data.

Algorithms :- Algorithms are a set of instructions which manipulates the input data to arrive at some desired result.

Iterators :- Iterators are objects which refer to an element in a container. And we handle them very much similarly to a pointer. Their basic job is to connect algorithms to the container and play a vital role in manipulation of the data.
