/*
 this problem is just like the previous problem but this time we are given the difference between 2 subsets,

 //Array is {1,1,2,3}
 //Given difference is 1
 //O/P is 3
 Now it can have multiple subsets
    i)   {1,3} & {1,2} ---> Sum of Difference is 1
    ii)  {1,3} & {1,2} ---> Sum of Difference is 1(The array had two 1s)
    iii) {1,1,2} & {3} ---> Sum of Difference is 1
